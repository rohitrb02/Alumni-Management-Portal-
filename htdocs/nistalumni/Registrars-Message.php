              <p align="justify">Dear NISTians,<br>

It is an honour for me to wish all our Alumni on the occasion of 25th establishment day of NIST.
You all always occupy a special position in NIST as you all are successful students of ours. And always you have made NIST proud of you all.

</p>
              <p  align="justify">You must be aware of the fact that in order to strengthen the relationship, an Alumni Association has been formed and registered. The main objectives of the Association are to promote close relations between the institute and its Alumni, promote the interest of the Alumni in the affairs of the institute, ensure that programmes are initiated and developed for the benefit of the Alumni and the Institute, and to assist the Institute in its development and pursuit of academic excellence. There is much an Alumni can do for NIST throughout her/his life. You are encouraged to do so in support of your alma mater. The Alumni Association can work as a bridge to stay connected with each other and work for win win situation for all stakeholders. It will give all of us a platform to contribute to the enrichment of our alma mater NIST and its students (past and present).</p>
				  <p  align="justify">
				Let us keep ourselves be informed about our achievements, laurels, progress in every field of our life. That will inspire others to take notice and use at appropriate places during their journey in their own life and career. It will also bring out some suggestions from more experienced alumni to make your journey more successful and fulfilling.</p>
				
				 <p  align="justify">We have a dream to continue with our path of academic excellence for all times to come.
We have a dream to give best possible experiences to our students, which they would cherish throughout their life.
We have a dream to make NIST a world class Institution in all respect.
We can only fulfill our dream with mutual admiration and cooperation. So, I am calling one and all to do cooperate with your Alma Mater NIST in fulfilling its dream.</p>
				 <p  align="justify">
I wish you all with your family to continue with your best journey in the life which ever field you are. Stay safe during this pandemic period.
				</p>
